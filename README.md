# tictactoe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with X and O until one achieves three in a row or the game ends in a draw. The project showcases basic game logic, turn handling, and win/draw detection, making it suitable as a beginner-friendly example of interactive game development and clean code structure
